# slide_menu_by_collectionview

It's a slide menu by UICollectionView.
Why i create this repository is because there are a lot of samples about this type.
But, i don find multi sections with UICollectionView.

So that I will try it.

this repository is inspired by https://github.com/rechsteiner/Parchment.
I made it based on that repository.
